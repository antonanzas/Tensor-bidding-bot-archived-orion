# Orion 🚀 *(Archived Project)*  

⚠️ **This project is no longer maintained.** The SDK it relied on has been completely revamped, making this version unusable.  

## About Orion  
Orion was a **CLI bot** designed for farming and implementing **bidding strategies** on the Web3 platform **Tensor** (Solana). It allowed users to outbid others based on specific parameters and NFT collections. At the same time, it enabled users to list NFTs and perform **undercutting**, keeping their listings at the top of the market for quick sales. Additionally, Orion provided **PNL (Profit and Loss) calculations** for a wallet that traded NFTs over a given time period, allowing users to track the profitability of a wallet.

This project aimed to automate and optimize bidding strategies, enhancing the speed and profitability of trading on the Solana network.. While it's no longer functional, I'm making it public as part of my development journey and for reference.
